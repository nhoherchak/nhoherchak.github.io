#Problem 1: 10 
#Problem 2.a: 10 
#Problem 2.b: 8 didnt state minimum number of spanning vectors
#Problem 2.c: 10 
#Problem 2.d: 8 minor mistake in row reduction
#Problem 3.a: 10 
#Problem 3.b: 10 Note: Do I need to be describing my answer in more detail?
#Problem 3.c: 10 
#Problem 3.d: IDK I did this question by finding the transpose of the incidence matrix.  In OH, I specifically asked whether I should make the matrix negative since B = -F^T (from discussion) where F = incidence matrix and B = B matrix and after a length discussion, the TA said I should.  I dont think I should lose any points since the TA gave me incorrect information and am also kind of frustrated that the TA did so.
#Problem 3.e: 10 See previous problem comment.  It messed up this part too since it was dependent on *d
#Problem 3.f: 10 
#Problem 3.g: 10 
#Problem 3.h: 0 
#Problem 3.i: 0 
#Problem 4: 10 d was wrong - rest correct
#Problem 5: 10 
#Problem 6: 10 
#Problem 7: 10 
#Problem 8: 8 mistake in row reduction for part d
#Problem 9: 8 mistake in angle for part b
